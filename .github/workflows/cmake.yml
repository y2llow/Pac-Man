5. Alternative: GitHub Actions (Easier Setup)
Create .github/workflows/cmake.yml:

yaml
name: CMake Build

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, master ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Install SFML
      run: |
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install -y libsfml-dev
        
    - name: Configure CMake
      run: |
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake ..
        
    - name: Build Project
      run: |
        cd build
        make -j4
        
    - name: Verify Executable
      run: |
        cd build
        file Pac-Man
        echo "Build successful!"
